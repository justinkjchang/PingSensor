HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ping Sensor Usage

Controlled by Arduino Nano 3.0 & sends serial data to Processing sketch, which graphs out the appropriate distance.

Potential uses:
- determining speed of moving object in one-dimension
- detecting shape of an object passing by

Future modifications:
- better noise reduction
- create menu to either movement detection or to graph the shape of an object
